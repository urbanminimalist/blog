Even the least experienced rider knows the terror of a chain stamp. Bike grease doesn’t come off easily. More tips on getting it off your skin at the end of this post. For clothing, I am still doing it poorly. I use “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014RIU51Y/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B014RIU51Y&amp;amp;linkId=3a43541891b6b53b8dd012560037e4be&quot;&gt;spray and wash&lt;/a&gt;” to treat the stain before washing. It does ok, but not great. Once those stain hits the dryer, it’s unlikely to ever come out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it’s said, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. What’s the prevention for bike grease? Inexperienced riders tend to just never lubricate their chains. Sure, it leads to lots of actual mechanical issues. It sounds awful, looks rusty and broken and is usually one step away from failure. I say this from experience. I volunteer as a bike mechanic for a large group ride that numbers between 900-5000 riders. It is massive. It is mostly inexperienced riders and I go through a lot of chain lube after getting questions like “why does it sound funny?” Ever touched a bone dry, two years of rust, chain? It’s nothing you are missing out on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until recently, I trended in the opposite direction. Forever dumping more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L6B0VO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002L6B0VO&amp;amp;linkId=90b74504302d794f91617e11d985af62&quot;&gt;white lightning&lt;/a&gt; “self cleaning” chain lube on the aforementioned mechanical rope. My chain was nearly black and constantly shed little black droplets of goo. It was merely the exact opposite of never using chain lube. I was using only chain lube, all the chain lube. On occasion, I would dump the chain in a degreaser. My chains were not lasting too long. And, since I ride fixed gear, I rely on my chain to guarantee I am going to accelerate and stop. I went through many chains. It wasn’t too horrible on the wallet. We will leave the impact on the environment for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am evolved. I tried to do it cheaply. I got what I paid for and learned my lesson. Now, I am sharing that wisdom with the Internet. The secret to avoiding a bicycle stamp? Chain cleaners. I know, it doesn’t sound that revolutionary. And, maybe you’ve already experimented with these devices. But, it may just be that you bought one of this ~$30 plastic ones. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YWQYC83/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07YWQYC83&amp;amp;linkId=390cd7547c50c945a037b32c1d570f16&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001XRTZPK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B001XRTZPK&amp;amp;linkId=2fd853e64cbf639b7f075b7a71533fab&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K5OALY6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00K5OALY6&amp;amp;linkId=bcedc82186597fd7ed57888044126f16&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While those work, they are made from plastic. I basically destroyed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K5OALY6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00K5OALY6&amp;amp;linkId=bcedc82186597fd7ed57888044126f16&quot;&gt;muc off&lt;/a&gt; brand chain cleaner I picked up on Amazon for $35 a few months ago. It doesn’t help that my bicycle doesn’t have a rear derailleur and the chain line doesn’t leave a lot of extra space to insert gadgets. And while a brush or D-I-Y solution is probably more minimal at first, I assure you that cleaning bike grease from your living room floor isn’t a great way to enjoy your free-time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best solution is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1B95OC/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M1B95OC&amp;amp;linkId=5a2d34929b89572c81d483b203516f56&quot;&gt;Park Tool CM-25 chain scrubber tool&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-clean-your-chain&quot;&gt;How to Clean your Chain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mount your bicycle in a stand. If you are riding a fixed gear, you must elevate the rear tire as it will have to turn.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1B95OC/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M1B95OC&amp;amp;linkId=5a2d34929b89572c81d483b203516f56&quot;&gt;CM-25 from Park Tool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1B95OC/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M1B95OC&amp;amp;linkId=5a2d34929b89572c81d483b203516f56&quot;&gt;CM-25&lt;/a&gt; case by ensuring the lid is unlocked, it opens with the mouth away from you when holding the handle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour a degreaser into the bottom reservoir.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place chain into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1B95OC/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M1B95OC&amp;amp;linkId=5a2d34929b89572c81d483b203516f56&quot;&gt;CM-25&lt;/a&gt;. Nestle the chain into the bottom portion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Close the lid&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Latch the silver locking mechanism. It will be vertical when locked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hold the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1B95OC/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M1B95OC&amp;amp;linkId=5a2d34929b89572c81d483b203516f56&quot;&gt;CM-25&lt;/a&gt; in your left hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pedal backwards with your right hand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlatch the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M1B95OC/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M1B95OC&amp;amp;linkId=5a2d34929b89572c81d483b203516f56&quot;&gt;CM-25&lt;/a&gt; and remove&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safely dispose of the degreaser. Do not pour into storm drains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pour water into the chain machine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 5-10&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dry chain with a towel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Re-lubricate chain with your favorite chain lube.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very important that you pedal backwards. All these chain machines are directional. Pedaling forwards will make the chain dirtier, much dirtier. And not the kind of dirty we like around here. In regards to degreaser. Park Tool makes a specially formulated kind designed for these machines. It’s expensive. I prefer Simple Green. It’s effective and environmentally friendly. I’m not linking to Amazon for Simple Green. It’s far cheaper at Walmart. Shop around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your chain is now cleaned and re-lubricated. Go enjoy a bike ride. You earned it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret to removing bike grease on the go and at home? A bar of lava soap or a container of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QJDGHO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B000QJDGHO&amp;amp;linkId=c1cb6fd74c71ea3ff95995aa8448f33b&quot;&gt;phil woods hand cleaner&lt;/a&gt; are my usual go tos at home. However, it was during the resurgence of bicycles at the start of the 2020 pandemic from COVID-19 that I discovered an amazing way to deal with it on the go. Regular soap, dish soap and hand sanitizer will not remove it from skin. You can scrub the skin off faster than you will remove bicycle grease. Thanks to a stranger, I learned this trick. After fixing a flat tire on the side of the street in a remote part of Brooklyn for a stranger I was gifted this secret. At the end tire change, my hands covered in grease from her never-been cleaned 1970s bicycle. As I looked down at my hands, I tried in vein to get the grease off with some hand sanitizer I had with me. It was useless. Then the woman handed me a on-the-go &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L6B0VO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002L6B0VO&amp;amp;linkId=90b74504302d794f91617e11d985af62&quot;&gt;Neutrogena face wipe&lt;/a&gt;. The same one women use to remove makeup. Men wearing makeup probably use it as well. Now, I join their ranks. Not because I am now wearing makeup. I don’t wear anything that didn’t get stuck to my chain after living in the streets of one of the dirtist cities in America. No. I am joining because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L6B0VO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B002L6B0VO&amp;amp;linkId=90b74504302d794f91617e11d985af62&quot;&gt;Neutrogena face wipes&lt;/a&gt; are amazing. I carry several with me whenever I ride. Both for myself and the person that I &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; help during my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

From those of us who drive cars  and need exercise, to those of us who relied on public transporation, 2020 has seen an unprecedented surge in cycling. The surge has been so vast, so significant that bikes, bike components, bike tires are sold out. Wait times at local shops for even trivial work ballooned from 2 days to 2 weeks. It’s the biggest surge in cycling since the 1890s. And, it’s awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to ride bicycles and enjoy the most minimalist configuration, you’ve arrived at the right blog to learn about how to equip and enjoy your bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are many types of bicycles and many types of cycling, this post is focused on the most pure and direct form: Urban fixed gear riding. Whether you call it a track bike, a fixed gear bike, a fixie or just the best bike ever, you will be needing a pair of handlebars. Let’s review 3 of the best choices in 2020. To keep it simple, all three bars selected have a 31.8mm clamp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-riser-bars&quot;&gt;1. Riser Bars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N1W9B4C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07N1W9B4C&amp;amp;linkId=c079707ae6c59d026397db3940910774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://urban-minimalist.com/assets/images/spank_oozy_trail_780.jpg&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the most popular, most useful and most fun handlebar style in 2020 is the riser bicycle handlebar. While there are many different brands with wide riser bars, there is one clear winner. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N1W9B4C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07N1W9B4C&amp;amp;linkId=c079707ae6c59d026397db3940910774&quot;&gt;Spank Oozy Trail 780 Vibrocore Bicycle Handlebar&lt;/a&gt;. Arguably, Nitto and Thomson are more popular in the fixed gear scene. However, there is a small company in Utah making handlebars primarily for mountain bikes, downhill bikes and trail bikes. These super wide bars are amazing. They provide enormous leverage over the front wheel. They make hills simple. Their patented Vibracore inner core cuts vibrations in a major way. The wide hand position allows the riders chest to open, which makes it easier to breath. Additionally, the stance is intimidating to cars in the rear view mirror. Spank actually makes an even wider bar at 800mm as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only caveats to these ultra wide risers is they require a 31.8mm clamp. Not to fear, however, both Thomson and Nitto offer a 31.8mm clamp stem. Additionally, Spank makes several excellent stems that look great! Get started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N1W9B4C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B07N1W9B4C&amp;amp;linkId=c079707ae6c59d026397db3940910774&quot;&gt;Spank Oozy Trail Handlebar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-drop-bars&quot;&gt;2. Drop bars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CLCG5DG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00CLCG5DG&amp;amp;linkId=d7aa1855d6c3482b2a7445fbda7a9cf1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://urban-minimalist.com/assets/images/thomson_carbon_fiber_drops.jpg&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drop bars are classic. They look great on many bikes. They offer the largest number of hand positions. And, they let cyclist tuck down to fight off head winds. Keeping with the 31.8mm clamp theme, the top drop bars for your fixed gear bicycle are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CLCG5DG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00CLCG5DG&amp;amp;linkId=d7aa1855d6c3482b2a7445fbda7a9cf1&quot;&gt;Thomson Carbon Road Handlebar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These bars come in a variety of widths. While 460mm is far narrower than 780mm risers, it allows for easily slipping between cars and splitting lanes. These particular Thomson drop bars are carbon fiber. Save weight and cut down on vibrations. While Carbon fiber isn’t as durable as steel, going with a reputable brand such as Thomson minimizes any potential issues due to poor craftsmanship. Get started with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CLCG5DG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00CLCG5DG&amp;amp;linkId=d7aa1855d6c3482b2a7445fbda7a9cf1&quot;&gt;Thomson Carbon Road Handlebar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-bullhorn-bars&quot;&gt;3. Bullhorn bars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MN6PK2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B078MN6PK2&amp;amp;linkId=16aea41b8356be9bc7fab66f4708caca&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://urban-minimalist.com/assets/images/cinelli_bullhor_handlebar.jpg&quot; class=&quot;full&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rode with bullhorn handlebars for over 7 years. They are extremely reliable, versatile and great on longer rides. And, they look darn good too! If you like having alternate hand positions, but never want to get into the drops, then bullhorns are a great alternative. When it comes to fixed gear bicycles, Cinelli is a well known brand. They make great frames and they make great handlebars. Enter the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078MN6PK2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B078MN6PK2&amp;amp;linkId=16aea41b8356be9bc7fab66f4708caca&quot;&gt;Cinelli Unisex’s Bullhorn Handlebar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to the riser bars, these are made from 6061-T6 aluminium and weigh just 290g. Bullhorns offer a number of hand positions and make it a little easier to get into an aero position by reaching forward. These handlebars make use of a 31.8mm clamp. Meaning, you can purchase any of the handlebars mentioned in this article and use the same stem. Options are fantastic.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

If you haven’t, get out and start riding! When you get back, we can watch others ride fixed. Now, let’s get inspired to ride!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-matt-reyes-tv&quot;&gt;1. Matt Reyes TV&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you love fixed gear freestyle (FGFS) then you’re going to love this channel. With regular guest Andy Sparks, these videos are high quality and beautifully edited. They are an amazing source of inspiration. Concise edits makes it easy to enjoy a few videos throughout the day. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2IemUl4De-BkhHOq2bUNTw/videos&quot;&gt;Watch Matt Reyes TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-reasonably-dangerous&quot;&gt;2. Reasonably Dangerous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Channel host Zach Gallardo lives and breaths fixed gear bicycles. Having spent the last year traveling to Asia to ride his fixed gear bike and emmerse himself in various bicycle friendly cultures, Zach is a down to earth person that makes riding fixed gear feel very approachable. He reviews various frames. He talks about components. And, he answers questions from viewers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/ZachGallardoFixed/videos&quot;&gt;Watch Reasonably Dangerous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-fernwee&quot;&gt;3. Fernwee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Channel host Martijn makes gorgeous, weekly, videos about cycling. From the great sound tracks to the concise editing, these videos are worth the time. While Martijn doesn’t exclusively ride fixed gear, he does race track bikes. He rides for Botje Racing Team. His channel covers a variety of different types of bicycle riding from gravel and road to track and bike packing. Martijn is based in the Netherlands and offers an excellent glimpse of riding in the Netherlands and throughout Europe. Additionally, Martijn regularly travels and films rides such as San Francisco to Los Angeles on a track bike as well as NYC sunrises. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/Fernwee/videos&quot;&gt;Watch Fernwee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;honorable-mentions&quot;&gt;Honorable Mentions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a two honorable mentions. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/FOADGang/videos&quot;&gt;FOAD Gang&lt;/a&gt;, which has done a series of videos about fixed gear tricks. It’s worth your time if you’re intersted in Fixed Gear Free Style (FGFS). Additionally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/c/TerryBarentsenVision/videos&quot;&gt;Terry Barensten&lt;/a&gt; does a hotline series about messengers riding fixed gear bikes in New York City. The hotline pieces are great. Terry doesn’t ride fixed himself. But, he does have a pulse on the messenger scene and it’s worth your time as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Warm weather reaches the northeast! Summer was late, but like usual, it’s in full force for the 4th of July weekend. We are spending time preparing for our new summer house. I am celebrating with posts to honor America, freedom and security. What better way celebrate freedom then capturing the top two, best, IoT video cameras of 2018 in the IoT Video market: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things, IoT, is a catchy title to mean stuff connected to the Internet. Really any appliance that can connect to the Internet is part of the wide category that is IoT. The security of these connections varies widely. One of the most useful IoT products are cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; cameras. And, I love my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; Video Doorbell. And, that’s not wrong! I have two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; cameras at the apartment in the city, and we live there! I bought an original Dropcam. It still works. That’s amazing! Plus, I added the new Nest Cam. The service is very affordable. We will definitely be adding several &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; cameras for our new summer house to keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cameras are not only great peace of mind, but also provide entertainment from all the hilarious moments captured of our cats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a minimalist aesthetic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; are gorgeous. Clean, elegant lines. Simple, neutral colors. Perfect in my home, as well as on my home. Google and Ring are making it easy to buy electronics that don’t look like electronics. That is to say, electronics that aren’t ugly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I know from experience that Nest is worth it, we are enjoying the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0177FO9X4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0177FO9X4&amp;amp;linkId=3e41c3e789022e8ad823d6ac1f99f012&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;discount&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0177FO9X4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0177FO9X4&amp;amp;linkId=3e41c3e789022e8ad823d6ac1f99f012&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;3 pack&lt;/a&gt;. The $200 savings over purchasing separately is substantial. We are going to need it too! The &lt;a href=&quot;/urban-life/cat-super-highway-for-second-home/&quot;&gt;new cat super highway&lt;/a&gt; is ambitious!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the indoor Nest cameras, we are also adding a mix of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M66NWOQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M66NWOQ&amp;amp;linkId=fba7b925b4b1f0bc6fc61d9d61a51de4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;outdoor cameras&lt;/a&gt;. I know these companies really want to imagine a world of platform “lock in”, but I am always going to find, purchase and use the best products. How the company who created that object imagines I will use it doesn’t really matter to me. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; cameras are far superior to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; in most ways except one. We’ll cover the one major difference below. It was a no brainer to grab the two pack of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M66NWOQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01M66NWOQ&amp;amp;linkId=fba7b925b4b1f0bc6fc61d9d61a51de4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;outdoor cameras&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt;. That brings our total up to 5 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; Cameras and our featured guest product, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; has the best IoT &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; on the market. I installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; for my family. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DM6BDA4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01DM6BDA4&amp;amp;linkId=03968e7aa3b7706bc845457288ec8e41&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DM6BDA4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01DM6BDA4&amp;amp;linkId=03968e7aa3b7706bc845457288ec8e41&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RVD&lt;/a&gt;  models have been operating for over a year without any intervention from me. I’ve found the service pretty good. Now that Amazon purchased &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DM6BDA4/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01DM6BDA4&amp;amp;linkId=03968e7aa3b7706bc845457288ec8e41&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; , I expect their service to improve. Google hasn’t really done much to Nest and Dropcam. Dropcam is a great company as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the summer home, we are going to be purchasing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring Elite&lt;/a&gt; doorbell. It’s their most ambitious doorbell. And, most expensive. The Pro was definitely good enough. But, we liked the Power over Ethernet feature. Also, I want the doorbell to be off WiFi if possible. This is the first Ring model that allow Ethernet connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring Elite&lt;/a&gt;, that brings the total to six IoT video cameras for our new summer home. Remember, IoT cameras are essentially passive monitoring at this point. If you need a full security system, Nest and Ring would be complimentary products. For us, the IoT approach is perfectly minimal. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071DZYTKY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B071DZYTKY&amp;amp;linkId=25d91c5bc3d99a78098f6bc4a65619ef&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt;  camera isn’t much of a camera, it’s just the doorbell. It gets a lot more foot traffic. The front door should get more foot traffic. That’s part of the appeal of using separate companies and products. I can ignore the Ring notifications when I don’t want to answer the door, while Nest can continue remaining vigilant. And there’s no worry that I am going to miss something important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The indoor cameras will be placed near the front hall, in the family room where we are building the cat super highway, and in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six IoT video cameras are capable of saturating a lot of bandwidth. I am considering the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MAW2294/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01MAW2294&amp;amp;linkId=3c75944870c006fc66a28eb15bb0339e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Google Home Wifi&lt;/a&gt; Router setup for convenience and to manage the traffic requirements of so many WiFi cameras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monthly service for all these cameras is slightly more expensive because it doesn’t enjoy the price discount due to additional vendors. In our case, from Ring. That’s a worthwhile trade off. The Nest camera user experience, quality and functionality make it the clear choice. Perhaps, when the new Google doorbell is ready, the Ring Elite will no longer has a place at our new home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Urban Minimalist</name></author><category term="modern" /><category term="best" /><category term="minimalist" /><category term="iot" /><category term="cameras" /><category term="iot-cameras" /><category term="list" /><category term="nest" /><category term="google" /><category term="ring" /><category term="furniture" /><category term="summer-home" /><category term="not-ugly-electronics" /><summary type="html">The Top, Best, Minimalist IoT Cameras For Summer Home of 2018.

If you haven’t read the whole story, now’s a great opportunity &lt;a href=&quot;/urban-life/fall-of-the-diamond-rise-of-the-sapphire/&quot;&gt;to read it&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t worry, I can wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, the investment that we made in the stock market over a Diamond, reached the 100% club. Our original investment of $14,500 is now worth over $36,000. We aren’t selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we had chosen to purchase a Diamond, our original investment of $14,500 would have immediately depreciated by 50%. Worse, a Diamond is completely illiquid! Instead, our investment is twice the size. A true investment in our future! My fiancée and I couldn’t be happier. And, while the stock market isn’t the right investment vehicle for everyone, certainly an appreciable asset means more for the future of two people in love.&lt;/p&gt;

Read all about the &lt;a href=&quot;/urban-life/cat-tree-that-isnt-ugly-cat-clouds/&quot;&gt;best, minimalist, cat trees of 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the original two clouds, I’ve added two more shelves to our aparment. Our tortise shell lives on the clouds! She takes meals, naps, and watches the world from there. Of course she still sleeps on our pillow at night, but enjoys the clouds while I work.  I only wish RefinedFeline made more in the steel line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I’d love to see a steel, wall mounted, vertical stair set to compliment the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZX3HKO/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B003ZX3HKO&amp;amp;linkId=a010238f80bafa429056938fb4a58ae5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Cat Clouds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IO94AFE/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01IO94AFE&amp;amp;linkId=0f3de568a95efc8e907dbd6d8e4b9813&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cat silhouettes&lt;/a&gt;

This post is dedicated to building the ultimate cat super highway for our new summer home. We haven’t closed yet, but I have my eye set on a few places and I’ve already taken measurements. As usual, budget is always aspirational and unlimited. Let’s dream big, we’ll bargin shop for it later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cat super highway will have 4 major components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One Entry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One Exit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple resting places&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Relevant location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important there be a separate entrance and exit on the super highway. We always have at least two cats. It’s a territory thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jacksongalaxy.com/blog/tips-to-catify-your-home/&quot;&gt;more tips&lt;/a&gt; on catifying your home from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399176993/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0399176993&amp;amp;linkId=8a6db8c7b49fd7254f286b7b217f18ca&quot;&gt;Jackson Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I not only like, I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like the Lotus line from RefinedFeline for many parts of this project. It’s the wood line, and has a much larger variety of styles. The largest, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DGNAL6A/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01DGNAL6A&amp;amp;linkId=2114220ba5312c31bd27607b43263ec2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lotus Branch&lt;/a&gt;, is a beautiful, graceful curving shelf that can accomodate multiple cats at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BA6LSK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004BA6LSK&amp;amp;linkId=7d272f7f57f93cd825e7ba15a77bcc0f&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lotus cat tower&lt;/a&gt; made the list of the non ugly cat trees, but we couldn’t find enough floor space at the apartment in the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to build the family room at our summer house as a shared space for the cats and humans. That means couches, television, internet for the people. And, for the cats, the highway plus all their favorite cat toys and some nice, ergonomic, cat dishes. As well as a few rest areas along the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, we are going to be adding a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00WBJGUA2&amp;amp;linkId=c213e2463c862a8b49f6f2132594c6c8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/a&gt; Camera for the second home because we won’t always be there. Read about &lt;a href=&quot;/urban-life/best-minimalist-iot-cameras-for-summer-homes/&quot;&gt;cameras for the summer home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lotus cat tower is a great companion piece, allowing easy access from the ground up to the wall shelves. I’m planning a fairly eloborate cat super highway for the summer home and the cat tower plays a central role!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BA6LSK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B004BA6LSK&amp;amp;linkId=7d272f7f57f93cd825e7ba15a77bcc0f&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Lotus cat tower&lt;/a&gt; will server as entrance one. For the exit, I want something a little more challenging. We will tackle the exit ramp, well exit stairs, and the final touches in phase 2.

A sparkling wine has to be bottled in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champagne_(wine_region)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Champagne&lt;/a&gt; region of France to actually be champagne. Everything else is just sparkling wine. A silly distinction. But, not much different from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bourbon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Scotch&lt;/a&gt; being named after a location. By the way, those pages are incredibly boring to read, but Bourbon and Scotch are great to drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you call it all champagne, or the more correct, sparkling wine, there is a proper temperature to enjoy sparkling wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sparkling-wine-cellar-settings&quot;&gt;Sparkling Wine Cellar Settings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sparkling White Wine 43 °F&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sparkling Rosé Wine 45 °F&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sparkling Red Wine 48 °F&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both sparkling red wine and sparkling white wine need to be served ice cold. If you own a proper wine cellar, you will want to make sure it can chill below 50 degrees. To properly enjoy sparkling wines, the optimal temperature is between 40 degrees and 50 degrees. If you’re able to cool to an exact temperature, set your wine cellar as indicated above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quick how-to on serving sparkling wine will come in handy when it’s time to have a party. When it’s time to shop for party supplies, it’s always nice to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HHBG9ZY/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=urbanminimali-20&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B01HHBG9ZY&amp;amp;linkId=dd4b5e38c7a251b3716289bf936cb996&quot;&gt;variety of wines&lt;/a&gt; available.&lt;/p&gt;

The taper-ground edge allows for added stability, easy honing and long lasting sharpness. The manufacturer recommends that it should be washed by hand for best results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though it’s nice to have a wide selection of different knives, I only have space for two large knives. Space constraints inherent to apartment life mean trade offs. A chef’s knife is a must have tool for chefs of any skill level. The top 5 best knives isn’t subjective. Knife quality is easily measured using sharpness, hardness and long term quality as guides. Each knife on my top 5 best chef’s knives is a high quality option. Any knife on this list of top 5 best chef’s knives will make quick work of any chopping or cutting task. Whichever knife you purchase, be sure to keep it sharp. Dull knives are the most dangerous knives.

One of the most interesting aspects of the consumption of ethyl-alcohol, it’s essentially impossible to know when you are in a blackout state. To achieve this state of being, you need to maximize alcohol intake, while also preventing death. And, not causing content loss due to nausea. The trick is eating some food at least 5 hours before you begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mostly, or completely empty stomach facilitates rapid uptake. This is &lt;em&gt;key&lt;/em&gt; to a blackout. You must drink more than can be processed in a short period of time. Once a blackout state is reached, the consumption of alcohol can be halted. Any strong anti nausea medication is suggested at this point. Marijuana is an ideal solution as it is socially popular among the intoxicated. And, it aids in retaining stomach contents until complete absorption. Halting the consumption of alcohol will cause the eventual end of a blackout state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve compiled a list of the top 5 best alcohols to get blackout drunk. Everyone has their own favorite personal poison. Add your favorite alcohol drink for getting blackout drunk in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-grey-goose-and-redbull&quot;&gt;1. Grey Goose and RedBull&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vodka and Redbull definitely provides the most intense blackout. Or, so I’m told. It’s a crazy night that I can’t recollect at all. I took my dose on New Year’s Eve. You’ll have to pay for the book to hear that story. But the combination of strong liquor, stimulant and rapid intake sets up the ideal blackout scenario. Definitely the number one blackout drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-johnnie-walker-black-label&quot;&gt;2. Johnnie Walker Black Label&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a wedding where I discovered the bride’s father had stashed a bottle of black label. I had the bartender pour liberally. Needless to say, vast quantities of whiskey always leads to a great blackout. To punctuate the wedding experience, I told off the bride’s parent – for being too rich – and then passed out during sex. A good blackout can only be claimed when your logic is as hopeless as your long term sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-old-crow-whiskey&quot;&gt;3. Old Crow Whiskey&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This stuff is actually not terrible. The trick is slamming 8oz and then waiting 20 minutes for the whiskey to take hold and properly numb the taste buds. Its price, cheap, makes it ideal for consumption in excess. I found a bartender in LES that would only flirt with me if I drank it. I ended up blacked out. And, I went home alone. Well played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;4-brass-monkeys&quot;&gt;4. Brass Monkeys&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combination of sweet orange juice, and the very powerful malt liquor of OE, Olde English, makes the Brass Monkey very potent. This drink, which is forever immortalized by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EQNgK8r7SM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Beastie Boys&lt;/a&gt;, lives up to its promises of funkiness. Brass Monkey, if you can choke it down, can definitely lead to a blackout state by spiking blood sugar while also flooding the body with cheap malt liquor. This effect can be achieved by almost any mixed alcohol drink. Another popular favorite is “gin and juice”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;5-anything-and-cocaine&quot;&gt;5. Anything and Cocaine&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a single drink. It’s a two step process. The cocaine is best applied to the nostril. Powdered stimulants are easily inhaled. Intoxication is immediate. Alcohol is best drank. Like always.  When alcohol is enjoyed with cocaine the body can easily bypass basic mechanisms, like falling asleep, and consume much more alcohol than should otherwise be possible. This makes it possible to get blackout drunk with even beer when combined with cocaine. However, cocaine isn’t legal. Getting an anything and cocaine is impossible, legally. But, it still makes the list. It’s a powerful way to reach a blackout state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethyl-alcohol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor. It’s best enjoyed, anytime, anywhere of your choosing. Though convention precludes its use during work. And law prohibits its use while operating motor vehicles. However you enjoy and abuse alcohol, if you’re planning to get blackout drunk, do so irresponsibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application of foods should be limited during any attempt at a blackout state. Consumption of carbohydrates like rice or bread can assist in slowing additional uptake. However, there is no remedy for alcohol that has already reached the blood stream. Hospital visits will be required in cases of alcohol poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You cannot know the minimum until you’ve explored the maximum of it. Over consumption is a distinctly human capacity. The edges of anything are best explored to understand the contrast. In the case of alcohol the edges of reality and dream, memory and forget, fun and truly in the moment only. A state of being that can only be experienced once is rare, unique to blackout. It’s foreign to the human experience to not remember. It’s prolonged in a blackout state. It’s the minimum to human existence to experience and not remember. Permanently, it would be disaster. But, in the temporary state of blackout, a unique portal of life can be had.&lt;/p&gt;
